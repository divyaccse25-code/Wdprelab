<b> Mismatched </b> is <i> a Netflix India coming-of-age series adapted from Sandhya Menon's novel When Dimple Met Rishi. The story centers on Dimple Ahuja, a tech-focused girl aiming to become an app developer, and Rishi Singh Shekhawat, a traditional romantic who seeks her out for a potential arranged marriage at a summer coding institute in Jaipur. While their relationship starts with a literal splash of coffee and deep personality clashes, they eventually develop a complex bond amid the pressures of competitive programming and teenage drama. Over three seasons, the narrative evolves from a lighthearted college romance into a more mature exploration of career ambition, identity, and heartbreak, culminating in a three-year time jump to Hyderabad where the pair must decide if their individual futures still include each other.
